##What is Rate My Hackathon?
RateMyHackathon is a site that lets students, employees, and everyone else post reviews about a hackathon and share their experience at that hackathon without sharing their identity. However, there ideally will be some form of verification to prevent spamming. This website lets users see upcoming hackathons and compare their historical ratings with those of other hackathons. A review of a hackathon on this site consists of a title, a venue rating, sponsors/prizes/funding rating, a food rating, a recommendation or not, amount of reimbursement, and a field for other comments.

##Why use Rate My Hackathon?
This website allows anyone to view, add, and share reviews of hackathons and becomes a powerful tool for hackathon organizers to view trends in the data such as attendee expectations, sponsorship goals, quality of food, and more. Additionally, this data can be extremely helpful for new hackers in making a better informed decision on whether or not to go to a hackathon.
